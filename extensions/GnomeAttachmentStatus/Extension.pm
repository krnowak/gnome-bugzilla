# Either rename already existing 'status' column to
# 'gnome_attachment_status' or create it. This should be a part of
# install_update_db, but this hook is a PITA when dealing with columns
# that have foreign key constraints. In our case, we wanted to remove
# a foreign key constraint from status column, but it is not really
# removed from schema, so on next run of checksetup it would be
# recreated. To remove it for good, we need to remove the status
# column. To do that, we need to remove the foreign key constraint
# anyway first, but it is not removed, because when install_update_db
# hook is run, foreign keys are not yet set up, so bz_drop_fk does
# nothing, but foreign key already exists in database. Without foreign
# key removed, we are getting errors when dropping a column.
#
# In short: argh!
