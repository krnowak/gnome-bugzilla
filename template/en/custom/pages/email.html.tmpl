    title = "About Bugzilla email" %]

<p> 
This page can help you
<ul>
  <li>Understand why you received email.</li>
  <li>Learn how to stop receiving email.</li>
  <li>Figure out how to change the conditions causing you receive
      email, including turning email notifications off entirely.</li>
  <li>Explain why you can't respond via email.</li>
  <li>How you can get help if things don't seem to be working.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>Why you receive email</b>
<p>
[% terms.Bugzilla %] sends out email to notify you of changes to bugs you
reported, modified, put yourself on the cc list, etc.  The full list
of reasons can be found at <a
href="userprefs.cgi">[% Param("urlbase") %]userprefs.cgi</a>.
There is a bug in the system in that it defaults to sending out mail
when other bugs are marked as a duplicate of the bug you are watching;
we intend to make that a configuration option defaulting to off.
Sorry for the annoyance.
</p>

<b>How to stop receiving email</b>
<p>
If you are on the CC (carbon copy) list of any [% terms.Bugzilla %] bug report
you can easily remove yourself. You receive a link 
to the corresponding report in the last line of every email you get from 
[% terms.Bugzilla %]. The link is also at the top. In order to unsubscribe
open the report, scroll down to the bottom, select your email address within
the  CC: box, tick <i>Remove selected CCs</i> and press the 
"Submit Changes" button. <br>

For other cases please refer to the comprehensive email settings 
mentioned below. <br>

Please keep in mind that we may depend on additional information from you to
successfully tackle a software problem we all would like to see resolved.
</p>

<b>How to change when (or if) you get email.</b>
<p>
Go to <a
href="userprefs.cgi?tab=email">[% Param("urlbase") %]userprefs.cgi?tab=email</a>
and unselect (or select) any relevant boxes for when you don't want to
get email.  If you want to disable email entirely, click on the
"Disable All Mail" button. After any changes, make sure to press the
"Submit Changes" button at the bottom of the page.
</p>

<b>Why you can't respond via email.</b>
<p>
Our version of [% terms.Bugzilla %] is simply a modified (albeit heavily)
version of mozilla's <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">bugzilla</a>.  They
provide no program to analyze emails, add relevant messages to the
[% terms.Bugzilla %] database, and send out updated emails to the relevant
individuals.  We haven't written one either.  Part of the reason for
this is that it's a really hard problem:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are lots of braindead mail clients that send emails in
      both text and html. [% terms.Bugzilla %] comments should be text only.</li>
  <li>Email clients and people often stick long footers on emails,
      which would reduce readability unless they were removed.</li>
  <li>People and email clients are horribly inconsistent about quoting
      previous text, making it hard to prevent each comment from
      including several previous comments with zillions of levels of
      quoting.  Such a scenario would make bugs completely unreadable
      with the web interface.</li>
  <li>People do stupid braindead things like sending out-of-office
      auto-replies to [% terms.Bugzilla %] messages; we don't want that spam being
      archived and showing up in everyone's inboxes.  (So any program
      analyzing emails needs to be able to discover these messages and
      automatically disable the person's account.)</li>
  <li>The standard issues -- how does one determine which fields
      should be changed via an email?  How does one differentiate that
      from normal text?  When a bug is filed against [% terms.Bugzilla %] itself,
      how do we differentiate comments explaining how to send an email
      in a way to change fields in a bug and actual attempt to change
      fields within that bug?</li>
  <li>Probably several more issues that we haven't thought of
      yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>
What this means is that if you want to send a response to someone, you
need to use the webform by going to the link specified in the email
sent to you.  If you are having problems with the system itself,
contact the bugsquad or bugmasters (see last section of this page).
Any email responses you send at this time will be discarded.
</p>

<b>Where to go for further help</b>
<p>
If things aren't working or you have a question not answered here
about the email system, feel free to email gnome-bugsquad AT gnome dot
org or bugmaster AT gnome dot org.
